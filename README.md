Explanations: 
For the first cube starting from the left I used a new three.js material called THREE.MeshToonMaterial. For the material I also adjusted some proporties giving a bumpScale of 5, color changes, and a few tweaks in the specular and shiniess properites.

The second cube was made from the tutorial from Lab3 using the Phong material from Three.js.

The third cube was made from the tutorial from lab3 using vertex and fragment scripts to generate a custom shader.

For the forth cube I created a new fragment scripted name fragmentShader1.frag and created four new uniform vector3 colors. To start off I mixed two shades of colors Perano and Lightpink, then mixed this color was dark violet, and lastly added lavender into the mix. Once the colors were generated and mixed. I created a cube and added the custom ShaderMaterial onto the cube.
